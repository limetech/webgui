# Dynamix Themes

This directory contains the themes for Dynamix.  Each theme is a CSS file that sets CSS3 variables used throughout the webgui.
Look at the existing themes to see how they are constructed and how to create your own.

The files that it sets variables for are located one directory up in `emhttp/plugins/dynamix/styles`.

* `default-color-palette.css` for the color palette of the webgui. These values are used in the themes and the base styles
* `default-base.css` for the default styles of the webgui for both top nav (black/white) and sidebar layouts (azure/gray)
* `default-dynamix.css` for the js libraries that have styles (jGrowl, tablesort, tooltipster, etc)
* `default-cases.css` for server case icon font
* `default-fonts.css` for the font families used in the webgui, including the UI icon font
* @todo explain the other files
